                "title": "Barbarian Stigmas",
                "description": "Barbarians are simple folk, often experiencing culture shock in cities, clinging to their beliefs despite seeming alien. They respect nature/gods, avoid demons, and believe in omens/luck/fate. Each has a stigma (positive: intense attraction; negative: intense fear/revulsion). Positive stigmas are sought for good luck; negative stigmas are avoided as bad omens.\n- Stigmatic Distraction: Losing a positive stigma (e.g., breaking a charm) or encountering a negative stigma halves combat bonuses and applies -15% to skills until resolved (escape/kill/forget after 1D4 days). Not a true insanity (positive not obsession, negative not phobia).\n- Role-Playing: Stigmas add suspense; e.g., a negative red stigma may lead a Barbarian to distrust red-wearing strangers, see red objects as omens of trouble, or link red locations to evil. Positive stigmas signal good luck.\n- Gaining Stigmas: Start with 1 stigma (level 1), gain 1 at levels 3, 6, 9, 12; traumatic events may add more. All stigmas are interconnected in the Barbarianâ€™s mind. Three+ negative stigmas at once act as a phobia, potentially causing a hysterical frenzy."

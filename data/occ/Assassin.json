Light armor (e.g., padded, leather) is preferred for stealth, heavier armor (e.g., chain, plate) for combat against well-armed foes. Personal taste also influences choice.\nPenalties: -15% to prowl, -20% to climb/scale walls in full splint/plate; -10% to prowl/climb in chain/scale; -5% to prowl/climb in studded leather. No penalties for hard/soft leather or padded armor."

They’re secretive, invitation-only, and less territorial, tolerating freelancers unless they threaten the guild. Some are tied to death cults worshiping vampires or dark gods."

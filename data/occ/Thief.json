Most prefer light leather (hard/soft/padded) for maneuverability, stealth (no metal noise), and dark colors (brown, grey, black) ideal for night work. Studded leather is a favorite, though some use heavier armor for combat. Penalties: -15% to prowl, -20% to climb/scale walls in full splint/plate; -10% to prowl/climb in chain/scale; -5% to prowl/climb in studded leather. No penalties for hard/soft leather or padded armor."

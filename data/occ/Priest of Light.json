                "description": "With rare exception, priests are not trained as men of arms or in the use of weapons and armor. Hand to hand combat is not generally part of the priest's teachings, though most travelling priests learn at least basic hand to hand combat. They are not men of magic just because they can cast a few spells; rather, they are theologians, philosophers, healers, men of learning, and liaisons between mortals and the gods.\nWeapons can vary, but most priests prefer staves and blunt weapons.\nPriests tend to favor light armor like padded or leather for maneuverability and comfort. Heavy armor is cumbersome, and metal armor hampers magic energy channeling. If more than 50% of the body is covered in metal (e.g., chain mail, scale, plate), the priest must spend 20% more P.P.E. to cast spells, and roll once on the following table for additional penalties:\n01-20: Reduce spell damage or effects by 1D4x10%.\n21-40: Reduce spell duration by 1D4x10%.\n41-60: Reduce spell range by 1D4x10%.\n61-80: Reduce both range and duration by 20%.\n81-00: No additional problems.\nPriests may wear any armor, but encumbrance penalties apply: -15% to prowl and -20% to climb/scale walls or swim in full splint or plate armor; -10% to prowl, swim, or climb in chain or scale mail; -5% in studded leather."

                "title": "Allegiance to a God",
                "description": "A priest must choose a god, pantheon, or religion to devote their life to, though affiliation with a formal church isn’t required. The deity(s) must align with the character’s alignment (e.g., a good character won’t worship a dark god unless shifting alignment). A pantheon may include varied alignments, but a good priest won’t serve evil gods within it, using them as cautionary examples.\nPriests typically swear allegiance to one or two gods but know all deities in their pantheon, their allies, enemies, and codes. Adherence to dogma is strict in temples but more relaxed for travelling priests, who may bend rules to help others.\nDisobeying or rebuking a deity brings punishment, often severe but fair. Forsaking a god strips all clerical abilities, skills, and experience, forcing the character to start anew with a new O.C.C. Reinstatement by the forsaken deity is rare and, if granted, starts at level one or two."

          "description": "The knight is skilled in the use of the lance as a weapon in combat and for tournaments. The knight gets the equivalent of W.P. Lance with the following abilities and bonuses: The roll of a 'natural' 20 (unmodified die roll) means the lance strike inflicts triple damage (instead of double; an otherwise successful strike does normal damage, including bonuses for being on horseback), or the strike can be used to unseat his opponent. An opponent may also be unseated with a modified strike roll that is 20 or greater. Opponents knocked from horseback take 1D6 damage from the lance, are knocked off their horse and take an additional 1D6 damage unless they successfully roll with impact/fall. The fallen rider also loses initiative and one melee action/attack. An opponent who is not on horseback, but standing on the ground can be similarly knocked off his feet and on his backside with the same result, except no additional damage from the fall. The player must announce his character's intention as to whether he intends to inflict damage or unseat his opponent."

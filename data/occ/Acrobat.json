                "description": "Acrobats and tumblers can wear any armor, but chain/heavy metal types impair movement during acrobatic/tumbling/gymnastic feats: -35% penalty to physical skills, -50% to balance/performance speed. Heavy armors (chain mail, full metal armor with leg plating/knee guards) restrict flexibility due to weight. Half metal armor reduces skills by -25%, balance/performance speed by -30%, and leap distance by 20% (half suits) or 50% (full suits). Most acrobats wear no armor or restrictive clothing when performing. Some modify full soft armor suits or have custom suits (padded high-necked short-sleeved shirt, thick vest, arm braces/bands) for performances/adventuring, offering optimum maneuverability with low protection; custom suits add +1 to A.R."

                "title": "The Five Laws",
                "description": "All druidic magic follows these principles:\n1. Law of Rebound: Lesser magic rebounds onto the caster when repelled by stronger magic.\n2. Law of Equals: Equal magical forces clash until one prevails, becoming stronger in future encounters.\n3. Law of Appearances: Question everything in magic; avoid obvious solutions.\n4. Law of Summoning: Unexpected results mean insufficient experience for the attempted magic.\n5. Law of Cause and Effect: Magic power equals effort invested; overreaching summons negative magic (bad luck).\nDruids must replenish earth energy via rituals (minutes to hours) and blood sacrifice, nurturing nature by pruning trees, planting seeds, and killing pests. Neglecting this risks spell failure and negative energy: aging twice as fast, bad luck (M.A. halved, -10% skills, -10 S.D.C., -10 P.P.E., -3 initiative), and eventual destruction. Selfish/evil use also incurs negative energy (GM discretion). Repentance restores abilities over time."

                "description": "Druids prefer natural armor (padded leather, wood, bark) over processed metal, which disconnects them from nature and hampers magic. Metal armor is only worn as a disguise, with penalties: -15% to prowl, -20% to climb/swim in full splint/plate; -10% in chain/scale; -5% in studded leather. Soft/studded leather or magic cloth/leather armor is favored."
